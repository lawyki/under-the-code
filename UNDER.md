# UNDER.md — Survey & Quality Log

A systematic survey of *Under the Code* (under.atheric.eu), taken 2026-07-06 as the
first structured quality pass since the book was written. This file records what the
site is, how it is built, what is strong, what was defective, what was fixed in
pass 1, and what remains for later passes. It is the working baseline for future
improvement work.

---

## 1. What the book is

An interactive HTML book: **5 parts, 18 chapters + one Bridge interlude, ~93,000
words, 242 inline-SVG figures** (222 diagram cards + 19 chapter heroes + the cover
art). Every figure is hand-drawn inline SVG, most with SMIL animation. No framework,
no bundler, no build step for the pages themselves — the only tooling is
`scripts/build-glossary.js`, which extracts defined terms from the part files into
`glossary.json`.

Published by Atheric (atheric.eu) as one of two proof-of-work products; deployed on
Cloudflare Pages from `public/`, auto-deploy on push to `main`.

### Page inventory

| Page | Role | Size |
|---|---|---|
| `index.html` | Cover, part shelves, full 18-chapter TOC | 23 KB |
| `part-1.html` … `part-5.html` | The book itself (3–4–5–3–3 chapters per part) | 313–473 KB each |
| `glossary.html` | Auto-built alphabetical index (JS-rendered from `glossary.json`) | 1 KB shell |
| `404.html` | Self-contained error page (own inline CSS, no book.css) | 3 KB |
| `book.css` / `book.js` | Single shared stylesheet + single shared script | 52 KB / 26 KB |
| `fonts.css` + `fonts/` | Self-hosted webfonts (added in pass 1) | 16 woff2, ~270 KB total |

## 2. Architecture

**There is no client-side routing.** `book.js` is not a router — each part is a
plain multi-anchor document; navigation is ordinary links + URL hashes
(`part-2.html#ch5`). `book.js` is five self-contained IIFEs:

1. **Figure fullscreen** — expand/close buttons injected on every
   `.diagram-card`/`.light-diagram`; View Transitions morph; "liquid rainbow"
   ambient layer while fullscreen (opacity-only GPU animation, pre-painted in DOM).
2. **Section progress rail** — desktop-only left rail, rebuilt per chapter from the
   `.chapter-nav` items via IntersectionObserver.
3. **SMIL pause/resume** — every figure's SVG animations are paused offscreen
   (IntersectionObserver, 300px margin) and forced on in fullscreen;
   `prefers-reduced-motion` pauses everything permanently.
4. **Reading progress + resume** — localStorage only; "Where you left off" card on
   the index; 90-day expiry.
5. **Glossary** — fetches `glossary.json`, attaches hover/focus tooltips to
   `<strong>/<em>/.key-term` occurrences everywhere except each term's first-use
   section, renders the glossary index page, adds the index-footer link.

The CSS is one file in a strict vocabulary: design tokens in `:root`, component
classes (`.diagram-card`, `.pull-quote`, `.insight-strip`, `.math-callout`,
`.summary-table`, `.timeline`, `.truth-table`, `.code-block`, `.memory-diagram`),
scroll-driven animations behind `@supports (animation-timeline: view())`, print
stylesheet, reduced-motion block.

### Design system

- **Palette**: near-black surfaces (`#0a0a0a`/`#111`/`#1a1a1a`) + warm paper
  (`#f5f0eb`/`#ede8e3`) + gold accent `#d4a853` (dim `#8a6a2a`); semantic
  blue/green/red for figure content only.
- **Type**: Playfair Display (display/serif voice), DM Sans 300 (body), DM Mono
  (labels, code, figure text). Consistent mono-smallcaps labelling idiom
  (10–11px, 0.1–0.35em tracking) everywhere.
- **Reading rhythm**: dark part-openers/heroes alternate with paper content
  sections; figures are dark islands inside paper; `.lead` drop-caps open chapters.
- **Motion**: SMIL inside figures; scroll-driven fade/underline flourishes;
  reveal-on-scroll for structural furniture only (prose is deliberately static).

## 3. Strengths (verified, keep)

- **Zero console errors** on all 8 pages, desktop and mobile viewports.
- **Zero broken links or anchors** — all 600+ internal hrefs (including deep
  cross-part references like `part-3.html#fig-11-12`) resolve; verified by script.
- **All 241 planned figures exist** — `docs/figures.txt` registry is 100% `[x]`,
  matches the HTML exactly; every SVG has a `viewBox`.
- **Disciplined CSS** — effectively no undefined classes in the HTML, no duplicate
  IDs, one shared stylesheet with a real token system.
- **Genuinely considered performance engineering**: SMIL paused offscreen, the
  fullscreen rainbow layer pre-painted + opacity-only, `contain` used deliberately,
  scroll-driven effects behind `@supports`.
- **Accessibility above static-site baseline**: `prefers-reduced-motion` honored in
  both CSS and JS (SMIL), keyboard/focus support on glossary terms, aria-labels on
  injected buttons, skip-safe print stylesheet.
- **Self-containment**: no analytics, no trackers, no CDN; state (progress,
  glossary cache) never leaves localStorage. As of pass 1, **zero third-party
  requests of any kind** (fonts now self-hosted).

## 4. Defects found & fixed in pass 1 (2026-07-06)

Objective breakage only; no restyling, no content changes.

| # | Defect | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Google Fonts loaded from fonts.googleapis.com/gstatic** on every page — the studio posture is zero third-party requests | Self-hosted: `fonts.css` mirrors the css2 payload (same families/weights/subsets/unicode-ranges → pixel-identical rendering); 16 woff2 files under `fonts/`; preloads for the five latin faces every page uses; all 8 pages switched. Playfair + DM Sans are variable fonts (one file per subset serves all weights); DM Mono is per-weight. |
| 2 | **Mobile horizontal page scroll** (375px and 320px) on parts 1–3 — wide `.summary-table`s (up to 618px), the ch4 `.memory-diagram`, and a long inline-`code` URL in ch11 pushed the whole page wide | `.summary-table` becomes a horizontal scroll container ≤768px; `.memory-diagram { overflow-x: auto }`; `code { overflow-wrap: anywhere }`; `.truth-table` given `max-width:100%; overflow-x:auto` as a guard. Verified: no page-level overflow at 1440/375/320 on any page. |
| 3 | **Fixed header height was unpinned** — `.book-nav` was padding-sized (real height 54px desktop; wrapped to 79–105px on phones) while `.chapter-nav { top:48px }` and `.part-opener { margin-top:48px }` assume 48px → sticky nav slid under the header and page tops were overlapped on mobile | `.book-nav` is now exactly `height:48px`, one line at every width: subtitle hidden ≤960px (new `.book-title-sub` span), part/chapter readout hidden ≤620px. Verified 48px at all three viewports. |
| 4 | **No way home** — no link to the cover anywhere on a part page (`.book-title` was a plain `<div>`) | Title is now `<a href="index.html">` (visually unchanged, `color:inherit`, no underline). |
| 5 | **Dead-end part endings** — every "End of Part N" section stopped with no affordance to continue; the `.next-btn` class existed in CSS but was used 0 times (unrealized design intent) | Each part's closing section now carries one `.next-btn`: parts 1–4 → next part, part 5 → back to the cover. |
| 6 | **`og-image.png` was broken** — the committed raster (macOS `qlmanage`) was mis-composed: title cropped off-canvas, white band at the bottom, wrong layout. This is what every social share showed | Re-rendered from `og-image.svg` in headless Chromium at 1200×630 @2× with the self-hosted fonts. Now matches the SVG exactly. |
| 7 | **Metadata inconsistencies** — README claimed "~210 figures" (actual: 242 incl. cover, as the cover itself states); `package.json` said `UNLICENSED` while the repo is CC BY-NC 4.0 | README count corrected with breakdown; `license: "CC-BY-NC-4.0"`. |
| 8 | **Index carried a `.liquid-bg` layer it can never use** (only fullscreen figures activate it; the index has none — glossary.html correctly ships without it) and its two infinite drift animations idled forever | Removed from `index.html`. |

## 5. Known non-defects / deliberate choices (do not "fix" blindly)

- `404.html` is intentionally self-contained (own CSS, reduced font set).
- The h2 "glass reveal" leaves a faint chromatic text-shadow at rest — intentional.
- `glossary.json` (248 KB) is fetched on every page; the localStorage cache only
  short-circuits parsing, not the network (the fetch itself learns the version).
  HTTP caching mitigates. Candidate for a version-stamped URL later, not breakage.
- The cover figure count (242) includes the cover art itself; `docs/figures.txt`
  tracks the 241 in-book SVGs.

## 6. Prioritized improvement backlog (later passes — needs owner sign-off)

**P1 — reader-facing polish**
1. **Figure a11y**: the 222 diagram SVGs have no `role="img"`/`<title>`; screen
   readers get only the label/caption text around them. A generated pass could add
   `aria-labelledby` pointing at each card's `.diagram-label`.
2. **Emoji as icons** in `.insight-icon`/`.concept-icon` (⚡ etc.) — inconsistent
   cross-platform rendering; the book otherwise draws everything as SVG.
3. **Chapter-nav active state**: `.nav-item.active` styling exists but no scroll
   spy sets it on the horizontal chapter nav (the left rail has one); minor JS.
4. **Glossary tooltips on touch**: hover/focus only; tap works via `tabindex` but
   dismissal is awkward. Consider tap-toggle semantics.

**P2 — performance**
5. Version-stamp `glossary.json` (e.g. `glossary.json?v=N`) + long-cache headers,
   or inline the generated version into a `<script>` per page at build time.
6. Part pages are 313–473 KB HTML (largely SVG). Fine gzipped (~60–90 KB), but a
   figure-lazy-mount pass (template + IntersectionObserver) would cut initial DOM
   size (~5,000–6,000 nodes/page) if mobile INP ever becomes a concern.
7. Consider subsetting the self-hosted latin fonts to the book's glyph set (the
   main site did this; saves ~40%). Deliberately not done in pass 1 — unsubset
   files are byte-served exactly as Google's, so rendering risk is zero.

**P3 — structural nice-to-haves**
8. Dead CSS: `.bit-row`, `.process-flow`, `.concept-grid`, `.scale-shock`,
   `.chapter-end`, `.diagram-grid-2`, `.tall` are defined but unused (legacy of
   earlier drafts). Harmless; strip in a cleanup commit.
9. `glossary.html` lacks canonical/OG meta (all other pages have full sets).
10. A "part N of V" progress indicator exists in the header but there is no
    per-chapter progress bar; the rail covers desktop only.
11. `docs/plan.txt` / `docs/figures.txt` "last verified" dates are stale
    (2026-05-01); re-verify after content edits.
12. **Cloudflare Pages pretty-URLs**: the host 308-redirects `/part-1.html` →
    `/part-1`, so every internal link (all hrefs use the `.html` form) costs one
    redirect round-trip, and canonical/OG URLs point at the `.html` form while
    readers land on the extensionless one. Either switch internal hrefs +
    canonicals to extensionless, or disable the redirect. Pre-existing, harmless,
    but worth aligning.

## 7. Verification protocol used (repeat after any pass)

```bash
npm run serve                      # localhost:8000
# headless: console errors, page-level h-scroll, nav height, font status,
# external-request detector at 1440/375/320 on all 8 pages
# link audit: every href/#anchor across all pages resolves
```

Pass 1 exit state: 0 console errors, 0 external requests, 0 broken anchors,
0 pages with horizontal scroll at 320px+, header 48px at all widths, fonts
self-hosted and loading (`document.fonts` confirms Playfair 400/500/i400, DM Sans
300/400/500, DM Mono 300/400/500), live-site parity confirmed after deploy.
